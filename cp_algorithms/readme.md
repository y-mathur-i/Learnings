### CP Algorithms


```
Binary Exponention
```
Lets say the power i want to raise n to is x = 13.
In binary it is 1101.
For 4 digits if i were to do n *= n

``
It becomes n^8 n^4 n^2 n^1
``
and if i multiply to result on each place there is a set bit i get same number if i were to numltiple n x times with itself.
