A pattern used in concurrent programming
It involves shared buffer, consumer, producer

The producer produces tasks and adds those to shared buffer
From the there the consumer picks those up

Shared buffer will have to be thread safe so multiple threads can access/modify it.
Without corrputing the data structure and creating a race condition.

Aditionaly if the size of the shared buffer is limited.

Sentinal value -> used to terminate the algo
Added to shared queue by producer to signal no further creation and used in last
by consumer to terminate the programm
